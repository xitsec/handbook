Internet Future Depends on Cryptography
=======================================

Julian Assange Call to Cryptographic Arms
-----------------------------------------

As the recent excerpt "Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet, by  Julian Assange with Jacob Appelbaum, Andy Müller-Maguhn and Jérémie Zimmermann.",  Julian Assange says, the future of the very internet is dependent on the use of  encryption. see http://cryptome.org/2012/12/assange-crypto-arms.htm As the internet, our greatest tool of emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen. Why? Their is a corrupt sector of society involving governments and corporations that has a serious interest in controlling the flow of information and knowing all of your personal information. This is the definition of totalitarianism. And encryption is THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THIS GLOBAL NEW WORLD ORDER. If all of your communications are not human readable it is not possible to censor you or surveil you.

 Anonymous 2013 Claim Abuse of Un-encrypted Citizen Data
-------------------------------------------------------

In the dispersement of the notorious hacker group Anonymous - http://paste.kde.org/662210/ the New World Order is explicitly explained as an elite quasi clandestine global criminal organization and that the fight over internet freedoms is actually the 3rd world war - the World Web War. As depicted by Anonymous, if the corrupt few are successful in poisoning information we could be entering one of the darkest periods in human civilization. Think high-tech Nazi's and you'll get the picture.
