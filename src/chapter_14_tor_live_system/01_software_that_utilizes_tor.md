Software That Utilizes Tor
===========================

What Software Utilized Tor
--------------------------

There is a growing list of software that implements TOR in addition to their existing services. Every day the list grows as more and more people are becoming concerned about their personal data and safety from cyber criminals, activists who want protection from oppressive governments, journalists communicating with a source even everyday citizens who want to protect their constitutional rights and civil liberties all are now using TOR due to it's ability to protect against location awareness.

Since Tor is a free open source network software that helps you defend against forms of network surveillance that threaten personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities, relationships  and state technology known as traffic analysis it has become very popular feature for software developers to include it in their software packages.

The only groups that do not like TOR is oppressive or corrupt governments, corporations that want to spy on you, law enforcement and criminals. They would rather that all your information and private data is in the clear over public internets and that your real IP Address is attached to it. Without this it is so very much harder to read your personal data and know your location, in fact so much harder that it takes specially skilled individuals to attempt to decipher the data or to design sophisticated software Trojan backdoors or traffic analysis filtering hardware or even devising methods to try to break TOR. Usually this involves high end intelligence personnel computer scientists and expensive equipment.

Not to say that it cannot be done but the intention to unwarranted access public data becomes so difficult that it consumes a significant amount of resources. Such that if your government choses to spend money on this it may be a question as to why it is so important to view each and every citizens regular data and this should be thoroughly investigated. The original legislation regarding telecommunications trace and tap was only authorized via court order in most countries and it is a Federal offense in many countries to open someone else's snail mail. Maybe it should be the same for internet communications - if not there is too much room for abuse by the corrupt.

Here is a short list of some software programs that are using TOR to protect your IP Address:

ON A COMPUTER
TOR software core - The core installation of Tor that can be installed on any operating system, then used to torize anything.
Browsers - The TorBrowserBundle which uses a torized version of the popular Mozilla browser to force encrypted browsing, email checking, forum posting, instant messaging, chatting, IRC, texting, skype voip or anything else that you are doing through your browser.
P2P Torrents - Vuze (formerly Azureus), a BitTorrent client written in Java, includes built-in Tor support.

ON A CELL PHONE
Orbot - A Tor implementation for Android as part of The Guardian Project.
Gibberbot - A secure, no-logging, instant messaging client that uses OTR encryption as part of The Guardian Project.
Orweb - A privacy-enhanced mobile browser as part of The Guardian Project.
ProxyMob - A Firefox add-on that helps manage the HTTP, SOCKS, and SSL proxy settings for integration with Orbot as part of The Guardian Project.
Secure Smart Cam - A set of privacy enhancing tools that offers encryption of stored images, face detection and blurring, and secure remote sync of media over slow networks as part of The Guardian Project.

ROUTER
Routers with built-in hardware support for Tor are currently under development through the Torouter project. The code is currently in the alpha phase of development, and runs on top of the OpenWrt platform.

LIVE OPERATING SYSTEM
TAILS - The TAILS Linux Distribution includes Tor as part of its web browser.

As talk increases in governments all throughout the world on legislating censorship and unwarranted surveillance the TOR Project is becoming more and more in demand as it is one of the only methods available to easily nix government and corporate interests to abolish legal rights and freedom of speech. As well since government seemingly holds the interests of profit over the rights of other citizens it is in the best interest of all citizens to stop this madness now by using encryption which essentially disables the censorship and surveillance mechanics.
