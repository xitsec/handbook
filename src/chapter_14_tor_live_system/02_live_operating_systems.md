Live Operating Systems
=======================

What is a Live USB Operating System
-----------------------------------

As a life long IT person with Software Engineering credentials, IT Security
credentials, Penetration Testing credentials, Cryptography credentials as well
as being an active hacker in the text only internet since 1978, there is only
one fully secure method to communicate on the internet and that is to never
connect to the internet. Yes - never connect to the internet.

At least never connect to the internet with your true operating system. But
rather boot into a temporary operating system on a USB to do all your internet work and then when you need to use the real operating system, reboot into the real operating system. That is what a Live Operating System does Â– allows you to use temporary operating system to surf so that your real operating system is kept safe.  

It cannot be any easier to protect security than to boot with a USB. This is what military personnel do. Only they add an extra layer of security with a CAC card which is a key for signing encrypted documents like emails that they send - or to sign into a virtual private network that they access like the Siprnet.

It is near impossible to perfectly secure a computer even if you are a security
expert and have hardened your operating system to perfection - you are still
taking a chance that someone out there might be able to subvert your
Windows / Linux settings whence you connect to the internet. In fact - many servers now use live operating systems - if suspected of being subverted one simply reboots to fix it in many cases. We are talking here of servers like those who run web sites (web servers) and database servers or mail servers and large production servers like Motorola.

Actually, there are other benefits to utilizing a virtual operating system, such
as the reduced possibility to obtaining a virus or malware infection from
internet sessions. And the loss of important data due to an infection which
corrupts your data.  Alternative to attempting to secure and anonymize software and an operating system to perfection is the use of a virtual operating system is a given. But what if there was a live operating system that includes all the secure software and that has already been hardened for you.

Enter the live TOR operating system.
